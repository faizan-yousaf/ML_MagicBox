    "# **K-Means Clustering**\n",
    "\n",
    "* K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science.\n",
    "* In this kernel, I will use K-Means Clustering to cluster the data points in the `make_blobs dataset`.\n",
    "* It works on unlabeled data.\n",
    "* It makes the groups based on the similarity of data points.\n",
    "* K-Means algorithm identifies `k number of centroids`, and then allocates every data point to the `nearest cluster`, while keeping the centroids as small as possible.\n",
    "* The `means` in the K-Means refers to averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working of K-Means Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "    1. Specify the `number of clusters K`.\n",
    "    2. Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data points for the centroids without replacement.\n",
    "    3. Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids. i.e assignment of data points to clusters isnâ€™t changing.\n",
    "    4. Compute the `sum of the squared distance between data points` and `all centroids` **WCSS**.\n",
    "    5. Assign each data point to the closest cluster `(centroid)`.\n",
    "    6. Compute the centroids for the clusters by taking the average of the all data points that belong to each cluster."

    "#### `Q: What is a Parallel Coordinates Plot?`\n",
    "\n",
    "A Parallel Coordinates Plot is a type of data visualization used to represent high-dimensional data. In this plot, each variable (dimension) in the dataset is represented by a vertical axis, and each data point is represented as a line that spans across all the axes. The position of the line along each axis corresponds to the value of the variable for that data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Structure of a Parallel Coordinates Plot`:\n",
    "Axes: Each vertical line in the plot represents one variable (feature) in the dataset.\n",
    "Lines: Each line connecting the axes represents a single data point or observation. The position of the line on each axis reflects the value of the corresponding variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `How to Use`:\n",
    "Identify Variables: Select the variables, each with its own vertical axis.\n",
    "Scale Data: Normalize or standardize variables for consistency.\n",
    "Plot Data Points: Draw lines connecting axes based on variable values.\n",
    "Color Coding: Use color to differentiate classes or groups.\n",
    "#### `Interpretation`:\n",
    "Patterns: Similar lines across axes suggest correlated variables.\n",
    "Clusters: Groups of parallel lines indicate clusters.\n",
    "Outliers: Lines that deviate from the norm indicate anomalies.\n",
    "Correlations: Crossing lines may suggest negative correlation, while parallel lines suggest positive correlation.\n",
